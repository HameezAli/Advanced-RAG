The analysis of these data\nprovides valuable insights- known as Precision agriculture(PA)- that can help the farmers to increase productivity,\nreduce cost, restrict the use of chemical fertilizers and water, increase revenue, understand the seasonal trend demand,\netc.[2], which has an impact on the agricultural market. The agriculture markets contribute a signi\ufb01cant portion to the\neconomic prosperity of a nation.\nAnalytics in the agriculture market is expected to grow because of the application of modern technology, rising\npopulation and, improved productivity. The competition among the business organizations- from the input suppliers to\nretailers in the supply chain is ever increasing, and analytics has provided a means for the competitors in getting ahead.\nFieldScripts- a prescription service for farming, owned by Monsanto, an agrochemical and agricultural biotechnology\ncorporation in the United States - provides a farming plan based on the two-year historical \ufb01eld data provided by\nthe farmers[3]. IoT (Internet of Things) has found immense application in agriculture analytics as a means for data\ncollection. In[4], the integration of IoT devices in the agriculture farms is proposed, and based on the data produced\nfrom these devices, predictions will be made for increased crop production and control of expenses.\nThe quality of soil is one of the critical factors that in\ufb02uence the quality of the crop produced. The soil data from\nsensors can be used for testing soil fertility, based on which the farmers can decide on the fertilizer and the plant to\nseed[5]. The wheat yield from the \ufb01elds in Bedfordshire, UK were predicted based on soil data and satellite images of\ncrop growth, using Supervised Kohonen Networks[6]. The increasing global food demand, pollution, degradation of\nsoil, etc. in\ufb02uence the quality and quantity of crops produced, a\ufb00ecting the agriculture supply chain. Understanding\ntheir in\ufb02uence is used for prediction, which provides the farmers, suppliers, and the government to reduce risk and\nmake better decisions for sustainable agriculture. In [7], the grain crop yield of China was predicted using Arti\ufb01cial\nNeural Network by understanding the in\ufb02uence of various factors such as climate, labour, irrigation, etc. using Grey\nRelational Analysis(GRA). In India, Microsoft uses AI sensors that allow the farmers to make timely decisions in\nfarming. In the villages of Telangana, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh, farmers, receive automated voice calls in\ncase of any pest attack, based on weather and crop stage[8]. The prices of crops are volatile, especially for tree crops\nand the crops cultivated annually. Unpredictable events such as drought and \ufb02ood can a\ufb00ect the prices of agricultural\ncommodities, thus a\ufb00ecting the entire market; the farmers, suppliers, exporters, and stakeholders face huge losses. In\n[9], the demand and share price of co\ufb00ee in the stock market of the Indian co\ufb00ee supply chain was predicted using\nthe Weighted Moving Average model that allows the exporters and stakeholders to make timely decisions to reduce\n\ufb01nancial loss and maximize pro\ufb01t. The farmers are most a\ufb00ected in the year of a bad crop, which leads to a massive\namount of debt. Based on a forecast, the insurance companies and government can support the farmers \ufb01nancially\nby providing insurance policies and loans at a\ufb00ordable interest rates. The prices of agricultural commodities are\nforecasted using various time-series, machine learning, and deep learning models.\nArecanut is an important commercial tree crop mainly cultivated in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam, West\nBengal, Meghalaya and Maharashtra[10].

Over the past few years, the prices of arecanuts had its\npeaks and valleys a\ufb00ecting the farmers and suppliers as a whole. India has the largest production of arecanut based on\nthe FAO statistics of 2013, with Kerala and Karnataka being the leading producers in the country, in terms of area and\nproduction. Climate change and government policies have a\ufb00ected the production and prices of crops.\nIn Meghalaya, the production of arecanuts is being a\ufb00ected due to increase in temperature[12]. Back in 2011, the\nprices of arecanuts in India took a hit when the supreme court banned some of the arecanut products[13]. As a result,\nthe farmers couldn\u2019t pay back the loan or interest. Farmers fall into huge debt, which results in increased suicide rates\nin the country. It is necessary to provide a solution to these price variations, as farmers are the driving force of the\nnation.\nUnderstanding the price \ufb02uctuations can provide an insight for the government and organisations in taking necessary\ndecisions for managing risk. The government can provide loans and insurance at reduced interest rates. The farmers\ncan also take timely actions in improving the production of the crop.\nThe 2018 Kerala \ufb02oods had a\ufb00ected the agricultural sector especially the arecanut plantations resulting in huge losses\nfor the government and producers[14] and farmers in Kerala are switching from arecanut farming to various other\ncrops because of price \ufb02uctuations and diseases[15]. Being second in terms of production, Kerala is facing a decline\nin Arecanut production.\nAnalytics are currently dominating the \ufb01nancial markets. Predicting price \ufb02uctuations allows the organizations to take\nnecessary actions for ensuring economic stability. Price variation is a common phenomenon in the agricultural mar-\nkets. Predictive analytics using various data mining techniques helps in understanding the trends and seasonality of the\nprice data. The importance of data mining in agriculture for crop price prediction is discussed in [16] where the prices\nof di\ufb00erent types of agricultural commodities in national and international markets were predicted using time-series\nmodels such as ARIMA, naive, exponential smoothing, etc. with better accuracy. The application of price forecasting\nin agriculture was discussed in [17] using exponential smoothing, ARIMA, expert judgement, econometric model and\ncomposite forecasting for predicting the prices of hogs in the US with forecasts from ARIMA models responding\nquickly to price variation. In [18], the prices of cocoa beans in Malaysia were predicted using exponential smoothing,\nARIMA, GARCH, variation of the ARMA model based on error variance, and a hybrid ARIMA-GARCH model. The\nhybrid model outperformed the performance-based on RMSE, MAPE, MAE, and Theil Statistics. In [19], the prices\nof paddy from Punjab, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and India were predicted using\nthe ARIMA model. ARIMA models were used for forecasting onion prices in Hubli of Northern Karnataka [20] and\nKolhapur of Western Maharashtra [21]. Based on the forecast, the prices were expected to increase. The Box-Jenkins\nmodel was used for forecasting coriander seed prices in Rajasthan [22].

Proposed Techniques\nIn this work, a model is \ufb01t for predicting the prices of arecanuts. The performance of classical time-series models-\nHolt-Winter\u2019s Seasonal Method, SARIMA model- and Machine learning model- LSTM were compared for \ufb01nding out\nthe most parsimonious model. Exploratory analysis indicated the presence of trend and seasonality in the time-series\ndata of prices. ARIMA and Holt-Winter\u2019s seasonal method is the commonly used statistical method in forecasting\ndata with trend and seasonality. These models are capable of producing forecasts with relatively good performance.\nLSTM model was selected as it has the ability to capture the non-linear dependence of the data points that makes it\nfavourable for time-series forecasting.\n3.1. ARIMA\nARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model is a variation of Box Jenkins models used for pre-\ndicting or understanding stationary or non-stationary time-series data. The Box Jenkins model plays a vital role in the\narea of time-series analysis and forecasting. ARIMA consists of three parts- the AR part, lag-di\ufb00erence(integrated),\nand the MA part, denoted as ARIMA (p, d, q) where p is the number of AR terms, d is the order of lag di\ufb00erence, and\nq is the number of MA terms.\n\u2022 AR: The forecast value will be dependent on the previously lagged value, i.e., lagged value as the predictor\nvariable.\n\u2022 Integrated: In order to make the time-series stationary, the lag di\ufb00erence is applied to non-stationary time- series\nfor parameter estimation and model selection.\n\u2022 MA: The predictor values are past lagged error values.\nThe seasonal variation model of ARIMA is the SARIMA denoted as SARIMA (p, d, q) (P, D, Q), used for data\nwith trend and seasonality. Also, it consists of seasonal AR, seasonal lag di\ufb00erence, and seasonal MA terms.

LSTM\nDeep learning model-LSTM was the machine learning model used for forecasting. The long-term temporal depen-\ndence is an important aspect to be considered in a time series data. Although there exists several other feedforward\ncontrol neural network and machine learning models such as Elmann Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, etc.\nfor time series forecasting, feedback control network are found to be useful as they have a memory state for consider-\ning the correlation in lagged values.Since RNN can use sequence data as input, it is very much useful for time series\nforecasting.\nThe main drawback of traditional RNN is the vanishing gradient problem where the gradient diminishes and \ufb01nally\nbecomes close to zero[33]. This problem is overcome using the LSTM network model;a type of RNN, which has a\nmemory and forget cell. LSTM consists of read, write and delete operation using di\ufb00erent cells in the hidden layers\nenabled by the three gates: input gate, output gate and forget gate.

Observations from 2007-2016 were used as\nthe training set, and the values from 2017 were used for testing. Since the amount of data available was limited, it was\nnot possible to allocate data-points for validation set as it would a\ufb00ect learning.\n4.1.1. Data preprocessing\nThe dataset contained missing values for most of the districts. For districts having missing values less than 50%, the\nlinear interpolation method was used. Wayanad district had the most number of missing values, which resulted in data\ninconsistency. These missing values were \ufb01lled using the multiple linear regression method. The predictor variables\nwere selected using the correlogram, a plot that consists of correlation between the predictor and forecast variable.\nDistricts having a correlation greater than or equal to 0.7 were selected as the predictor variable. The dataset was\nsimpli\ufb01ed by taking the average of district-wise monthly data. The price of arecanuts is per 100 numbers. Forecasting\nwas done using ARIMA and Holt-Winter Seasonal method, and their performances were compared.\n4.1.2. Exploratory analysis\nThe increase in prices of arecanuts with time in Fig. 4., indicates the presence of an increasing trend, and the\npresence of seasonality is indicated from the box plot in Fig. 5., with the prices increasing and decreasing during\nparticular months.

As Kerala is second in terms of production of arecanuts, the work will help\nthe arecanut producers in managing their resources for better production of crops with maximum pro\ufb01t based on\nthe forecast of prices. Based on a number of previous works, statistical methods were dominating in predicting the\nvariation of prices.
