This is implementation detail not always obvious.\n\n3. **What are the exact steps taken to parse and transform documents before indexing with Chroma?**\n    *  The pipeline definition (`SentenceSplitter`, `TitleExtractor`, `QuestionsAnsweredExtractor`) reveals a specific data processing workflow unique to this demo.\n\n\n**Contextual Summary:**\n\nThis code demonstrates a Streamlit-based interactive question answering system built on LlamaIndex. It leverages Groq for both document transformation and query execution. The key takeaways are:\n\n* **Groq Integration:**  The code heavily relies on Groq's API for both LLM-based document processing and query answering.\n* **Chroma Vector Store:**  ChromaDB is used as the underlying vector store for efficient document retrieval.\n* **Custom Data Pipeline:**  The code defines a custom pipeline for parsing, extracting information (titles, questions & answers), and preparing documents for embedding.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like more questions or deeper dives into specific aspects of the code!"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date", "page_label"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8525df82-24d8-4dea-8a95-b244f90f1300", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Acer\\Desktop\\Intern\\Advanced-RAG\\main2.py", "file_name": "main2.py", "file_type": "text/x-python", "file_size": 3651, "creation_date": "2025-06-23", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-23"}, "hash": "8f3a8320cc20bf80769f9e2abb07646d5ac4236e740bbd8385e1c63bbcf4ea6f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "import os\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\nimport nest_asyncio\r\nimport chromadb\r\nfrom llama_index.core import SimpleDirectoryReader, VectorStoreIndex, StorageContext, load_index_from_storage\r\nfrom llama_index.core.node_parser import SentenceSplitter\r\nfrom llama_index.core.extractors import TitleExtractor, QuestionsAnsweredExtractor\r\nfrom llama_index.core.ingestion import IngestionPipeline\r\nfrom llama_index.embeddings.huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbedding\r\nfrom llama_index.llms.groq import Groq\r\nfrom llama_index.vector_stores.chroma import ChromaVectorStore\r\n\r\nnest_asyncio.apply()\r\nVECTOR_DIR = \"./vectors\"\r\nCHROMA_DIR = \"./chroma_db\"\r\n\r\nst.title(\"\ud83d\udcda LlamaIndex RAG with Groq\")\r\nst.subheader(\"Load once, ask anything!\")\r\n\r\n# Input Groq API key\r\ngroq_api_key = st.text_input(\"\ud83d\udd11 Enter your Groq API Key:\", type=\"password\")\r\n\r\n# Proceed only if API key is provided\r\nif groq_api_key:\r\n\r\n    os.environ[\"GROQ_API_KEY\"] = groq_api_key\r\n    parsed_flag = os.path.exists(VECTOR_DIR)\r\n\r\n    # Load or create index\r\n    if not parsed_flag:\r\n        st.info(\"Parsing and embedding documents...\")\r\n\r\n        # Load documents\r\n        docs = SimpleDirectoryReader(input_dir=\"./\").load_data()\r\n        for doc in docs:\r\n            doc.text_template = \"Metadata:\\n{metadata_str}\\n---\\nContent:\\n{content}\"\r\n            if \"page_label\" not in doc.excluded_embed_metadata_keys:\r\n                doc.excluded_embed_metadata_keys.append(\"page_label\")\r\n\r\n        # Define LLM for transformation\r\n        llm_transformations = Groq(model=\"gemma2-9b-it\", api_key=groq_api_key)\r\n\r\n        # Transform pipeline\r\n        pipeline = IngestionPipeline(transformations=[\r\n            SentenceSplitter(separator=\" \", chunk_size=1024, chunk_overlap=128),\r\n            TitleExtractor(llm=llm_transformations, nodes=5),\r\n            QuestionsAnsweredExtractor(llm=llm_transformations, questions=3)\r\n        ])\r\n\r\n        # Run transformation\r\n        nodes = pipeline.run(documents=docs, in_place=True, show_progress=True)\r\n\r\n        # Vector store & index creation\r\n        from chromadb.config import Settings\r\n        vector_store = ChromaVectorStore(\r\n    persist_dir=CHROMA_DIR,\r\n    chroma_client_impl=chromadb.Client(Settings(chroma_db_impl=\"duckdb+parquet\", persist_directory=CHROMA_DIR))\r\n)\r\n\r\n        hf_embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbedding(model_name=\"BAAI/bge-small-en-V1.5\")\r\n        index = VectorStoreIndex(nodes, embed_model=hf_embeddings, vector_store=vector_store)\r\n\r\n        # Persist index\r\n        index.storage_context.persist(persist_dir=VECTOR_DIR)\r\n        st.success(f\"Indexed and saved {len(nodes)} nodes!\")\r\n    else:\r\n        st.success(\"Index already exists.
